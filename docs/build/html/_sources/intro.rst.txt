============

``knowknow`` is a Python package, knowknow, is an attempt to make powerful, modern tools for analyzing the structure of knowledge open to anyone. Although I hope we can continue to improve the methods and documentation written here, and I intend that this grow larger than myself, this package acts as a stabilizing force for the field, giving us all access to the common methods and data for analyzing these structures.
Getting Started
***************

As a newbie experimenter/hobbyist in the field of IoT using BLE communications, I found it pretty hard to identify a Python package which would enable one to use a Raspberry Pi (Zero W inthis case) to swiftly scan, connect to and read/write from/to a nearby BLE device (GATT server).

This package is intended to provide a quick, as well as (hopefully) easy to undestand, way of getting a simple BLE GATT client up and running, for all those out there, who, like myself, are hands-on learners and are eager to get their hands dirty from early on.

Examples
***********

- As my main use-case scenario was to simply connect two devices, the current version of :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient` has been designed and implemented with this use-case in mind. As such, if you are looking for a package to allow you to connect to multiple devices, then know that off-the-self this package DOES NOT allow you to do so. However, implementing such a feature is an easily achievable task, which has been planned for sometime in the near future and if there proves to be interest on the project, I would be happy to speed up the process.

- Only Read and Write operations are currently supported, but I am planning on adding Notifications soon.

- Although the interfacing operations of the :class:`bluepy.btle.Service` and :class:`bluepy.btle.Peripheral` classes have been brought forward to the :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient` class, the same has not been done for the :class:`bluepy.btle.Descriptor`, meaning that the :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient` cannot be used to directly access the Descriptors. This can however be done easily by obtaining a handle of a :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleDevice` object and calling the superclass :meth:`bluepy.btle.Peripheral.getDescriptors` method.
